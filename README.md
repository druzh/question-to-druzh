Hello druzh,

My name is Pavel Tashev. I noticed that you have reserved the organization name "easymail" which has one empty repository. 
With a friend of mine we are working on an OpenSource project which is called EasyMail. Its idea is very simple, to provide
a solution which can be used by anyone for free to build a mail server which is able to send hundreds of emails for free.

I don't know if that's the right way to do that, but I would like to ask you whether you are going to use the organization name "easymail"
and if not, may I please ask you to release it in order to use it for the OpenSource project.

I will be very thankful if that's possible.

Regards,
Pavel Tashev
