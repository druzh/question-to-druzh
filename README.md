Hello druzh,

I presume that you have read my "message" _(pull request)_. I suppose you would like to keep "easymail" and you are working on a project which will be published there. The way I contacted you might be a bit irritating for you but I had to try. I hope you understand that. 

Our team will search for another proper name for the OpenSource product. 

In case you are interested in what we do, we can share more info and the whole product.

Regards,
Pavel Tashev
